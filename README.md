Disclaimer:

Before you poke around, know that I know that these are all really simple basic easy projects. These (mainly my Other-Projects folder) are fun little goofy things that I like to do for fun and take like ten minutes to make and aren't complicated or cool. I still like them and am not embarrassed but it is important that you know that I know that these are pretty basic.

Think of this not as an art gallery of my best, finished works but as a sketchbook of fun little doodles.
