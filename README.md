Hello! This is me but you will not be able to see anything because I just have a bunch of really bad really tiny private repositories and I will update this probably never because I just realized I haven't made anything here and this is definitely not going to help me with anything.

This is basically where I back up my code, but maybe one day it will be a public portfolio. Check back in a few years and maybe you will see some public projects! But don't keep your hopes up.
