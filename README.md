Disclaimer:

Before you poke around, know that I know that these are all really simple basic easy projects. These (mainly my Other-Projects folder) are fun little goofy things that I like to do for fun and take like ten minutes to make and aren't too complicated.

Think of this not as an art gallery of my best, finished works but as a sketchbook of fun little doodles.
